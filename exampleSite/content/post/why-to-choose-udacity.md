It has been a long-term dream of mine to have a responsible position within Digital Marketing. With this clear goal in mind, I have been searching for it. Unfortunately, with no Marketing qualified studies in my resume, chances were against me. And I was proven right when applying to those jobs. One day after beating myself up due to no responses or “thanks, unfortunately, you don’t have the desire requirements” - all study-wise since I have been managing people for six years and five marketing years on my shoulders - I wondered **Do something!**-. Hence, I stepped back, had a look at what I may be missing, and realized that wasn’t experience or passion. It had to do with the lack of studies related to the field that I did not make the cut when applying.

So, with that in mind, I started to check every single course, master and degrees – yes, I was determined to start a four-year career at 33- and I felt overwhelmed with the number of possibilities and their claims of being the best of the best. Honestly, I did not know what to do, what to choose, in which of all those claimed masters I should enroll in to make my resume look reliable. While reading, probably all the possible reviews on the internet, I came across the Digital Marketing Nano Degree of Udacity. And being in the final three, I asked to myself:

**Will Udacity’s Digital Marketing Nanodegree help me achieve those marketing roles I cherish very closely?**

And the answer was an absolute **YES**, and let me tell you **WHY**.

1. *A free tip for you*. Being a huge LinkedIn fan, I noticed the number of people I follow that had studied in Udacity and had a very successful career.

2. The amount of work you put into each project is similar to what you will encounter in any master. So that shows you how serious they are about this nanodegree and in being contemplated as an option to improve not only your skills and knowledge but also relevant to seek job opportunities.

3. The wider view they give you in regards of marketing will serve you well if you are only familiarized with just one side of the digital marketing world, such as myself- a Social Media nerd here. Now I am more confident planning, executing, and talking about SEO, SEM, or E-Mail Marketing.

4. Last but precisely not least, this Nanodegree is recognized by and Partnered with Google, Facebook, and Hubspot, alongside other big marketing companies, which makes a huge difference from other courses or masters.

I hope this blog entry helps you find out whether the Digital Marketing NanoDegree is for you or not and, but, overall, I wish I was able to save you some valuable time while you search for ways to score your dream job.
