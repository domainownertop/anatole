It has been a long-term dream of mine to have a responsible position within Digital Marketing. With this clear goal in mind, I have been searching for it. Unfortunately, with no Marketing qualified studies in my resume, chances were against me, and I was proven right when applying to those jobs. One day after beating myself up due to no responses o “thanks, unfortunately, you don’t have the desire requirements” - all study-wise since I have been managing people for six years and five marketing years on my shoulders - I wondered **Do something!**-. Hence, I stepped back, had a look at what I may be missing, and realized that wasn’t experience or passion. It had to do with the lack of studies related to the field that did not make the cut when applying.

So, with that in mind, I started to check every single course, master, degrees – yes, I was determined to start a new career at 33- and I felt overwhelmed with the number of possibilities and their claims of being the best of the best. Honestly, I did not know what to do, what to choose, which of all those claimed masters I should enroll in to make my resume look reliable. While reading, probably all the possible reviews on the internet, I came across the Digital Marketing Nano Degree of Udacity. And I asked to myself

Will Udacity’s Digital Marketing Nanodegree help me achieve those marketing roles I cherish very closely?

And the answer was an absolute YES, and let me tell you WHY.

1. Being a huge LinkedIn fan, I saw the number of people I follow that studied in Udacity and had a very successful career. Here is a free tip.

2. The amount of work you put into each project is similar to what you will encounter in any master. So that shows you how serious they are about this nanodegree being considered as a master.

3. The wider view they give you about marketing will serve you well if you are only familiarized with just one side of the digital marketing world, such as myself- a Social Media nerd here. Now I am more confident planning, executing, and talking about SEO, SEM, or E-Mail Marketing.

4. Last but precisely not least, this Nanodegree is recognized by and Partnered with Google, Facebook, and Hubspot, alongside other big marketing companies, which makes a huge difference from other courses or masters.

I hope this blog entry helps you find out whether the Digital Marketing NanoDegree is for you or not and, but, overall, I wish I was able to save you some valuable time while you search for ways to score your dream job.
